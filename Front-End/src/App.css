/* App.css - Interfering Global Styles REMOVED */

/*
  The following rules applied to #root were removed because they
  constrained the width, added padding, and centered text globally,
  which interfered with components like Login and Home that need
  to control their own full-viewport layout.

  REMOVED:
  #root {
    max-width: 1280px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
  }
*/

/*
  The following rule applied a transparent background to ALL elements (*),
  which overrides intended background colors/gradients set in components
  or their specific CSS files.

  REMOVED:
  *{
    background: transparent;
  }
*/


/* --- Keep other styles below ONLY if they are specifically needed --- */
/* --- by the App.jsx component itself or genuinely global patterns --- */

/* Example: Logo styles (if used in App.jsx) */
.logo {
  height: 6em;
  padding: 1.5em;
  will-change: filter;
  transition: filter 300ms;
}
.logo:hover {
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 2em #646cffaa);
}
.logo.react:hover {
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 2em #61dafbaa);
}

/* Example: Keyframes (if used) */
@keyframes logo-spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

/* Example: Media Query (if used) */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  a:nth-of-type(2) .logo {
    animation: logo-spin infinite 20s linear;
  }
}

/* Example: Card style (if used as a generic card in App.jsx) */
.card {
  padding: 2em;
}

/* Example: Read-the-docs style (if used) */
.read-the-docs {
  color: #888;
}

/* --- ADD any other styles truly needed by App.jsx itself below --- */
